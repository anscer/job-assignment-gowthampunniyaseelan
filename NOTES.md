# State Management System

## Improvements for State Management

1. **Enhanced Properties**:
   - Add `priority` property to states to indicate the importance level.
   - Add `assignedTo` property to track which robot or user is responsible for the state.

2. **Data Streaming**:
   - Use WebSockets to stream real-time state changes from robots to the application.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement a logging system
